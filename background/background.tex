\chapter{Background}

This chapter will introduce the necessary background to this project. It will begin by
introducing software diversity; What it is and why it is desirable. A brief overview of
Constraint Programming and the LLVM code generator will be included to explain the
pre-requisite of Unison, the primary tool that will be used throughout this project.
