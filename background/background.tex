\chapter{Background}

This chapter will introduce the necessary background to this project. It will begin by
introducing what software diversity is and why it is desirable. There will also be
a high-level description of Unison, the primary tool used throughout this project. As
pre-requisite for Unison there will also be a section about constraint programming.
