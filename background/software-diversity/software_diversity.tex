\section{Software Diversity}

Software diversity is a diverse field, and there is research focusing on different areas
with different goals in mind. However, what they all have in common is the that they are
exploring the potential benefits of engineering diversity within software development.
When talking about software diversity there are a few different classifications and goals
\cite[Section~1]{survey} which will be covered here. 

\subsection{Managed Software diversity}

Managed software diversity is the notion of encouraging or controlling software diversity.

\subsubsection{Natural Diversity}

A lot of software with similar features naturally and spontaneously emerges from engineering
processes. There are a multitude of products from competing organizations that provide
the same function, for example routers, web browsers, compilers, database management systems
and firewalls. Natural diversity could also be something as simple as one program being
tunable by parameters to provide different functionality and performance \cite{survey}.

\subsubsection{Design Diversity}

Design diversity is the process of introducing diversity through the design process. For
example, \textit{N-version programming} is the approach where $N \geq 2$ functionality equivalent
programs are developed from the same specification. The point of this is that hopefully
it will result in a subset of the programs being free from bugs that another subset 
might suffer from, thus creating a more fault tolerant system \cite{n-version}.

\subsection{Automated Software Diversity}

\textcite{survey} describes automated software diversity as \say{techniques for artificially 
and automatically synthesizing diversity in software} \cite[\pno~8]{survey}

% This is where we are!
% More emphasis here!
\subsection{Goals of Software Diversity}

Software diversity has a diverse (heh) set of goals ranging from fault-tolerance to reusability
to security.
