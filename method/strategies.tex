\section{Strategies}
\label{sec:strategies}

% Revise: "In this thesis we define and compare three strategies to automatically
% diverse versions of the binary code for a given program
For the purposes of this paper only a few strategies will be evaluated. The chosen
strategies are \textit{enumeration}, \textit{instruction schedule} and
\textit{register allocation}, and the motivation for each is presented in the respective
subsections.


\subsection{Enumeration}

The name of this strategy comes from the fact that we are only concerned that the solutions
are different, not how they differ. During search the Gecode search engine will never
explore the same combination twice, and thus never generate two equal solutions. The
strategy is thus to not post any constraints at all and let the solver generate all
possible combinations. We \textit{enumerate} the solutions.

Unison can differ the solutions in four main ways:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The order of the operations is different
	\item Operands are connected to different registers
	\item Execute a copy using a different instruction (or not at all)
	\item Split live-ranges and spill temporaries differently
\end{itemize}

The results of this strategy serve as a baseline for the program. It is literally what
happens if we do nothing.

\subsection{Registers}

The strategy to diversify the register allocation of the resulting binaries is an attractive
one due to causing no run-time overhead. Consequently, if it introduces significant diversity
it is an excellent candidate. As register allocation is one of Unison's primary purpose it
feels like a natural strategy to explore.

There are two variables and one set that are of concern when diversifying the register
allocation. Their description from the Unison documentation are as follows:

\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent\makebox[\textwidth]{
	\begin{tabular}{c|lr}
		\textbf{Type} & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
		\textbf{Set} & $P$ & The set of all operands in the program \\ \hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Variable}}
			& $x_p \in \{0, 1\}$ & whether operand \textit{p} is connected (0 is false and 1 is true) \\
			& $ry_p \in \mathbb{N}_0$ & register to which operand \textit{p} is assigned \\
	\end{tabular}
}

\vspace{0.2cm}

In order to disallow the same register allocation we post the constraint:

\vspace{0.2cm}
\noindent\makebox[\textwidth]{
	$\neg (\bigwedge\limits_{p \in P} ( (x_p = prev.x_p) \land (ry_p = prev.ry_p) ))$
}
\vspace{0.2cm}

Very important to note is that the variables preceded by \textit{prev.} (i.e $prev.x_p$ and
$prev.ry_p$) represents an actual value. More precisely the value that is part of the previous
solution. For example $prev.xy_p$ represents the register to which operand $p$ is assigned
in the previous solution. The variables not preceded by \textit{prev.} are variables in
the constraint programming sense and their corresponding domains make up the remaining
combinations to explore.

In words; We disallow the exact same combination of connected (used) operands and
operand to register mapping.

\subsection{Instruction Schedule}

Given how Unison functions diversifying the instruction schedule is an exciting strategy.
As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:unison} Unison explores optional copies. In practice this
means that during pre-processing optional \textit{operations} are inserted so not only
does Unison decide on the order the instructions are executed, but in a limited capacity
Unison also inserts instructions (or deems instructions unnecessary). For the purposes
of breaking gadgets shifting instructions can help immensely as an adversary is reliant
on the exact addresses of the gadgets.

There are two variables and one set of interest for this strategy. In the Unison
documentation they are described as follow:

\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent\makebox[\textwidth]{
	\begin{tabular}{c|lr}
		\textbf{Type} & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
		\textbf{Set} & $O$ & The set of all operations in the program \\ \hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Variable}}
			& $a_o \in \{0, 1\}$ & whether operation \textit{o} is active (0 is false and 1 is true) \\
			& $c_o \in \mathbb{N}_0$ & issue cycle of operation \textit{o} \\
	\end{tabular}
}

\vspace{0.2cm}

In pseudo mathematical notation we want to post the constraint:

\vspace{0.2cm}
\noindent\makebox[\textwidth]{
	$\neg ( (\bigwedge\limits_{o \in O} (a_o = prev.a_o)) \land (\bigwedge\limits_{m \in \{O | prev.a_m = 1\}} (c_m = prev.c_m)) )$
}
\vspace{0.2cm}

Just as for the registers strategy constraint, the variables preceded by \textit{prev.}
represents the actual value that is part of the previous solution, whereas the ones not
preceded by \textit{prev.} are the constraint programming variables used when searching for
future solutions.

The constraint described with words is that we disallow the exact same combination of
active operations and their corresponding issue cycle. We are only concerned about the
issue cycle of the previous solution's active operations, but we do take into account that
future solutions can have the same instructions issued at the same cycles if it has fewer
or more active operations.

As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:unison}, some operations can be implemented by multiple
instructions. For the purpose of breaking gadgets we do not want to allow functionally
equivalent instructions. While they would indeed make the sequence of bytes differ, the
functionality would be the same and the gadget would survive.
