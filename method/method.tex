\chapter{Diversification with Unison}

The two strategies explored by \textcite{large-scale-automated} proved to be
effective and Unison is very capable of employing both of them. Specifically, the two
strategies where to randomize the instruction schedule and randomly inserting no-op
instructions. With Unison we also have the opportunity to fine-tune them. For example,
instead of randomizing the entire instruction schedule we can focus on randomizing at a
certain distance from any return instructions.

Since these fine-grained strategies can be implemented as constraints we do not need to
consider if they can break program functionality, since if they do the constraint solver
will simply not find a solution at all.

\section{Strategies}

\subsection{Constraining Difference}

The trivial strategy for diversification with Unison is to simply require all executables
to be \textit{different}. Unison can differ code in a few ways (see \ref{sec:unison}):

\begin{itemize}
	\item The order of the instructions is different
	\item The used registers are different
	\item Execute an copy using a different instruction (or not at all)
	\item Split live-ranges and spill temporaries differently
\end{itemize}

One of the techniques that will be evaluated is to simply require that all executables
are different \textit{in some way}. This would be the Unison equivalent of randomizing
the instruction schedule, but supposedly the diversity space will be larger as
\textit{different} entails more than just the instruction schedule.

\subsubsection{Diversify only Instruction Preceding Returns}

Since gadgets typically end in a "ret" instruction we can constrain solutions to be different
from a certain length from a "ret" instruction. This will most likely shrink our diversity
space, but hopefully it will also make more of an impact on the number of shared gadgets
between executables.

A problem with this approach is that any potential hidden gadgets will not be broken. Since
we cannot search for gadgets in the LLVM MIR the only way to break hidden gadgets is to
assume they are everywhere. Nevertheless the strategy will be tested.

\subsection{no-op Instructions}

To introduce even more possible combinations we can add an optional no-op instruction
between each of the original instructions. This would be the Unison equivalent of randomly
inserting no-ops. This technique can extend all the previously mentioned approaches.
