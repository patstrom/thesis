\begin{abstract}
	Unison is a tool that combines instruction scheduling and register allocation as a
	single combinatorial problem and solves it using constraint programming, which is a
	programming paradigm for systematically solving combinatorial problems.

	Automated software diversity is the process of automatically providing diverse executables
	in an effort to break so called \textit{gadgets}, which are short instruction sequences
	that make up an attack vector. Attacks that utilize gadgets rely heavily on the
	arrangement of the executable. By providing a population of executables with equivalent
	functionality but different arrangements an adversary must construct a unique payload
	for each executable.

	The results when using Unison to systematically generate diverse executables show that
	the number of possible pairwise distinct executables is often larger than 1000000, even
	for small functions (<10 instructions). Using Unison to force the executables to differ
	in a particular way is simple to implement, only a handful lines of code. One strategy
	evaluated in the experiment resulted in that the most frequent gadget only appeared in
	24\% of versions, and 82\% of the gadgets only appeared in one program version each.
	However, future work is required before anything consumer oriented can be evaluated, in
	part because Unison does not support the x86 architecture.
